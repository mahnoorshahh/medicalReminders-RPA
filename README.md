# medicalReminders-RPA
Automated Medication Reminder System with UiPath and Arduino
This project aims to tackle the critical issue of medication non-adherence by automating the delivery of personalized medical reminders to patients using UiPath Studio. By leveraging robotic process automation (RPA), we enhance patient health outcomes and reduce healthcare burdens through timely and adaptive reminders.

Project Overview
Medication non-adherence can lead to adverse health outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Traditional reminder methods are often ineffective and require manual intervention. Our solution addresses these challenges by automating the reminder process and integrating hardware signals to ensure patients adhere to their medication schedules.
Technical Overview
UiPath Studio:
Utilized for automating the extraction of medication schedules from patient emails and organizing data within Excel.
Arduino Integration:
Hardware component to provide physical reminders through LED lights, complementing digital notifications.
Excel Automation:
Automated data management and real-time updates of medication schedules.
Objectives
Automate Medication Reminders:
Reduce manual management and ensure accurate and timely reminders.
Improve Medication Adherence:
Enhance health outcomes by ensuring patients follow their medication schedules.
Streamline Data Management:
Organize medication information efficiently and adapt to changes seamlessly.
Integrate Hardware Signaling:
Provide additional physical notifications to support digital reminders.
Enhance Patient Experience:
Create a user-friendly system that simplifies medication management.
Conclusion
Our project leverages UiPath Studio and Arduino to automate medication reminders, improving patient adherence and health outcomes. By automating routine tasks and integrating hardware signals, we offer a comprehensive solution to address medication non-adherence effectively.
